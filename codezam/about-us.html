            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>What was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown. Both were 
            curious, but only one was brave enough to want to explore. That 
            was the problem. There was always one that let fear rule her life.</p>

            <p>Frank knew there was a correct time and place to reveal his 
            secret and this wasn't it. The issue was that the secret might 
            be revealed despite his best attempt to keep it from coming out. 
            At this point, it was out of his control and completely dependant 
            on those around him who also knew the secret.</p>
